      '"Our daughters have been receiving tutoring from Sean for the past 2 years. His knowledge and expertise in Math and Science has helped them stay on top of their work and kept them on pace with the course curriculum. His friendly attitude and patience has given them so much confidence in their abilities. He has been able to assess their needs and scaffold the work to meet them where they are. He is reliable and always makes time for extra sessions if they have a big test or assignment due."',

      "Sean has been my daughter's AP Calculus teacher for the past two years. He is an amazing teacher and we are blessed to have him as her tutor. His conceptual approach in his teaching strategies has helped her not only learn the materials more fundamentally but also become a better learner and more confident in applying knowledge in different topics and subjects.",

      'After failing my first calculus AB exam, my friend who was also struggling in calculus referred me to Sean. After starting tutoring sessions, I never received below an A on a test in AB. After starting BC, I initially struggled, but once I started tutoring with Sean again, I went from a B to an A in the class within a month. Although I still receive tutoring from Sean, I feel as though he has not only supported me as I learn new concepts, but provided me with the skills and interest in calculus necessary to be self-sufficient and independently receive a good grade in future math classes. In comparison to typical tutors, Sean doesn’t create dependent students; rather, he inspires students to enjoy math at a fundamental and conceptual level and develop the skills necessary to thrive independently in the future. Sean inspired me to think about math and calculus with a whole new perspective that I had never even considered before starting tutoring. He taught me how to apply concepts to basic facts of life that I’d never realized were intrinsically related to math, or in many ways, a product of it. Though I still feel like receiving tutoring from Sean is highly beneficial to my scores and understanding, I can also recognize the difference in my independent ability to retain, comprehend, and fundamentally understand new concepts since starting tutoring with Sean. He incited a passion and interest in mathematics that turned mundane, tedious, and seemingly incomprehensible concepts into fascinating ones. Besides calculus, Sean has also helped me in AP Physics. He has a wide variety of skills and knowledge that allows him to tutor various concepts and subjects. Sean is an all around intuitive, insightful, and smart individual who explains and elaborates concepts in ways no teacher has ever been able to do for me. I am appreciative of Sean not only because he’s a good teacher, but because he made me passionate about something I never thought I had the capacity to enjoy.',

    testimony:
      'We are very happy with Sean’s support as a tutor for our kids. Sean has tutored both our sons since we moved from Europe during high school and they experienced gaps in their knowledge in maths and had some adjustment issues. Sean helped our oldest son with AP Calculus and our youngest with Algebra 2, Statistics and Physics. Besides the fact that they appreciated the clear and pleasant manner in which he explains the maths to them (he isn’t their first tutor so the kids have comparison), they also enjoyed meeting up with him online (Covid) and thanks to Sean getting them to cooperate with tutoring was never an issue. Sean is a pleasant, kind, smart and patient person who helped them understand the maths, finish their homework and, last but not least, grow more confidence, which in my opinion is where the actual learning starts. He makes maths doable and even enjoyable for them and based on the conversations I had with him about my boys, it is obvious he sincerely cares about them and he really wants them to do good in school and feel good about themselves. I highly recommend Sean as a tutor for any class he is interested in himself. Because he is totally capable of sharing his enthusiasm and knowledge.',

      'Three of our sons have worked with Sean for tutoring in Geometry, Algebra, Algebra II Honors and AP Calculus. Though all were strong students, Sean’s expertise was invaluable, especially during distance learning. He is enthusiastic, personable, and presents material from a fresh, relatable perspective. Whether your child is struggling, has missed concepts due to absence, or just needs material presented in an alternate fashion, Sean can help. He will build or restore the confidence required to excel in math. We have been extremely happy with our experience with him.',

      'I have had a wonderful experience with Sean Keegan. When my classes moved online there was a disconnect between me and the material, especially in math. Sean Keegan was really able to help me and adapt in a way that my teachers could not. He is extremely knowledgeable, and makes learning new material simple and easy, whether in person or remote. I would definitely recommend!',
