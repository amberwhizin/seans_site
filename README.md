  - notes for me:
  what i did GIT!

  - git checkout -b videoGalpal
  - git push
  - git push --set-upstream origin videoGalpal
  - went to github and made a pull request
  - "git checkout -"  (main)
  - checked for merge conflicts and waited for vercel to check their end
  - merged
  - git pull
  - success!

  more git fun divergent 
  - git checkout -b main3.0
  - git checkout - (main)
  - git fetch origin main
   - From github.com:amberwhizin/seans_site
   -  * branch            main       -> FETCH_HEAD
  -  git reset --soft FETCH_HEAD
  - looked at all the files i wanted to keep(back arrow-discard changes) OR accepted new green files (+) and commited those
  - there were two files that i created in another branch(other than main) that arrived deleted. so i copy pasted them into new files i made into components and they disapeared from commit arena.
  - All good!
